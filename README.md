# Prrrecious

ðŸŽ‰ **Prrrecious** is a simple and lightweight app designed to help you quickly share your most important files, like personal memes, SSH public keys, CV PDFs, and more, without any fuss.

## Features

- **Add files in bulk**: Files are not copied, just referenced, so they remain in their original locations on disk.
- **Delete files easily**: Remove files one by one using the right-click context menu.
- **Quick drag-and-drop**: Drag an item out of the Prrrecious window to copy it into a messenger or other application.
- **Duplicate check**: Automatically checks if a file path has already been added to prevent duplicates.
- **Usage counters**: Keeps track of how many times you've tried to share a file. You can toggle the counters from the toolbar.

## Why Prrrecious?

I created Prrrecious as a no-nonsense solution to quickly share a few personal files, like memes, in corporate messengers without having to navigate through Finder or cluttering up my Desktop. 

## Installation

You can get Prrrecious for free on the Mac App Store. There is an optional in-app purchase available if you need to add more than 5 files.
